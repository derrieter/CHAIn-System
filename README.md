CHAIn System

**Description**

CHAIn (Combining Heterogenous Agencies' Information) is a system designed to facilitate data sharing during emergency response situations where data sources may be large and unknown. If a query to a data source fails (because the correct format is not known), CHAIn will perform automatic matching to find approximations to the query, and return results which, though not precisely correct, may still be useful.  The matching system returns this information to the user - for example, a decision maker coordinating a crisis response.  They then need to choose what use to make of the data.
